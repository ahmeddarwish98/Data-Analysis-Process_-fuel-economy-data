Data Analysis Professional - Data Analysis Process Case Study 1 - fuel economy data provided by the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency.

The test data used to determine fuel economy estimates is derived from vehicle testing done at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers who submit their own test data to EPA.

Each year, EPA provides fuel economy data to the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that they can administer their fuel economy-related programs.

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

    Model – vehicle make and model
    Displ – engine displacement in liters
    Cyl – number of engine cylinders
    Trans – transmission type plus number of gears
    Drive – 2-wheel Drive, 4-wheel drive/all-wheel drive
    Fuel – fuel(s)
    Cert Region 
    Stnd – vehicle emissions standard code. See Stnd Description.
    Stnd Description – vehicle emissions standard description.
    Underhood ID – engine family or test group ID.
    Veh Class – EPA vehicle class.
    Air Pollution Score (Smog Rating).
    City MPG – city fuel economy in miles per gallon
    Hwy MPG – highway fuel economy in miles per gallon
    Cmb MPG – combined city/highway fuel economy in miles per gallon
    Greenhouse Gas Score (Greenhouse Gas Rating).
    Comb CO2 – combined city/highway CO2 tailpipe emissions in grams per mile.
